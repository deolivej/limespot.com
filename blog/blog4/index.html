      <h2>LimeSpot: A New Paradigm Shift</h2>
	  </div>

      <div class="text-left">
			<p>Up until now e-commerce pages have largely been static, displaying a fixed or random selection of products, and providing little interactivity. Shoppers who visit regular e-commerce pages have to dig through pages and pages before finding products they&#39;re interested in. If they’re searching for a review or want to discuss products with a friend, they have to use entirely different websites. </p>
			<p>All this is about to change. </p>
			<p>LimeSpot represents the integration of e-commerce with social networks, which will bring immense new functionality to the world of online shopping. When a shopper goes to a website with LimeSpot-powered e-commerce, they will immediately (upon authentication) be presented with products they are likely to be interested in - even if they have never been to that store before. They will be able to use a variety of social features to interact with products, other shoppers, and the retailer itself. Their information will also be highly secure: a shopper&#39;s e-commerce actions will never be tied to their account. </p>
			<p>The best news? This incredible service is affordable for businesses of all sizes. Whereas the recommendation engines before LimeSpot were only available to Fortune 1000 companies, our suite of e-commerce functionalities were built to be used by small, medium, and large businesses with scaling payment plans. </p>
			<p>The most obvious impact of these changes will be the advancement of e-commerce efficiencies. A store powered by LimeSpot will maximize its chances of making sales by quickly connecting shoppers with products they genuinely like. </p>
			<p>LimeSpot will also add much-needed authenticity to the world of e-commerce. By matching shoppers to specific products when they choose to visit a store, businesses will allow consumers to enjoy their brand because of the products they create - not due to a barrage of advertisements. </p>
			<p>Social features will both create transparency by allowing shoppers to discuss products on the sites they are sold on; and publicize genuinely good brands by allowing shoppers to directly connect their products to social networks. </p>
			<p>With rising concerns on internet privacy, shoppers will also start to demand more from online stores. Previous recommendation engines have relied almost exclusively on sharing and storing consumer’s information without their permission. The public has notorious distaste for such practices, and LimeSpot proves that e-commerce recommendations can be conducted without harvesting people’s information against their will. </p>
			<p>No longer will online shopping exclusively consist of browsing and purchases: it will become a lively, social world that caters to the individual. Truly, these features and qualities represent a paradigm shift in the world of e-commerce.</p>
