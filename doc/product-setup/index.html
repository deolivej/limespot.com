<h2>Import and Set Up Products and Collections</h2>
<p>Products are the ultimate building blocks of your online store.  Products are often physical goods, but they can also be digital downloads like eBooks or software; or services such as insurance or rentals. In the LimeSpot engine, similar products are grouped into collections that present a high level view of the product&#39;s type. </p>
