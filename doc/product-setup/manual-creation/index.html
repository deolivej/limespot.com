<h2>Manual Creation of Products</h2>
<p>Small and medium-sized businesses with a limited number of products can use this feature to manually create products one at a time from the Admin Panel.</p>
<p>The Products section of the Admin Panel is where you can manipulate and view your products. Products will be listed here no matter how they were uploaded to LimeSpot.  </p>
<p>The landing page of the Products section looks like this:</p>
<img src="{{ root_path }}/img/products-manual-1.png"></img>
<p>From this page you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Manually create new products.</li>
<li>Import multiple products using an Excel spreadsheet.</li>
<li>View products as they are seen to customers.</li>
<li>Create copies of products.</li>
<li>Edit product details.</li>
<li>Delete products.</li>
</ul>
<h3>How to Manually Create New Products</h3>
<ol>
<li>Select the Products tab from the Admin Panel.</li>
<li>Click on the + icon present at the top left corner of the page. You will see the following screen.</li>
<img src="{{ root_path }}/img/products-manual-2.png"></img>
<li>Enter a Title for your product.</li>
<li>Select a Product Type from the Drop down list.</li>
<li>Enter a Product Description that will describe the product to shoppers.</li>
<li>Verify that the status of the Active checkbox is as you want it. The Active checkbox makes the product visible or invisible to your customers.</li>
<li>Upload images of your product for customers to view. You can upload a maximum of 5 images from either your local machine or a website URL that contains an image file. </li>
<li>Add Product Variants representing different versions of the product (more details <a href="#variants">below</a>).</li>
<li>Choose appropriate Targeting Rules* that you wish to associate with the Product. These will define which customers your products appear to.</li>
<li>Click on the Save button to complete the Process.</li>
</ol>
<p>* Our system provides a pre-generated list of Targeting Rules that cover most widely used conditions. However, you are free to create your own Targeting Rules from the Admin Panel.</p>
<h4><a id="variants"></a>Product Variants</h4>
<p>Product Variants are used to record different versions (such as different styles, colors, sizes, etc.) of a single product. For example, variants on a jacket could include small, medium, and large versions.  LimeSpot gives you the freedom to choose multiple Product Attributes for different product variants.</p>
<p>Product attributes that should be entered for every new product variant are as follows.</p>
<ol>
<li>Title: the title of your product variant, related to size, color etc. </li>
<li>Barcode: if applicable, the barcode number can be used for inventory tracking and billing.</li>
<li>SKU: the SKU code helps identify products variants.</li>
<li>Price: the price (excluding taxes) that you want to set for that product variant.</li>
<li>Original Price: if a product has been discounted, you can show its original price here so customers will see how much they are saving. </li>
<li>Stock Override: this checkbox enables your store to continue selling a product variant even after its Stock Quantity has reached zero.</li>
<li>Stock Quantity: this field indicates the available stock quantity of a particular product variant.</li>
<li>Active: this checkbox is used to make a products variant visible or invisible in your LimeSpot store.</li>
</ol>
<p>In addition to the fields mentioned above, you can choose up to a maximum of 5 custom product attributes that suit your industry needs.  Refer to <a href="{{ root_path }}/doc/store-setup/">Store Setup</a> for details.</p>
<p>Every new product should be associated with an appropriate Product Type that groups related products under a single identity. This is useful feature for showcasing all products of a specific category in your store instead of individual products. Refer to Creating Product Types for details.</p>
