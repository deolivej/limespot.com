<h2>Integration with Unlisted E-commerce Providers</h2>
<p>We strive to continuously add support for automatic integration of LimeSpot shops with major Ecommerce systems. </p>
<p>Currently we suport the following e-commerce providers:</p>
<ol>
<li>Shopify</li>
<li>Magento</li>
<li>BigCommerce</li>
</ol>
<p>Please contact Customer Support if you need assistance for integration with an e-commerce system for which we do not support automatic integration.</p>
<p>Some other alternative methods of adding products onto LimeSpot platform are:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="{% root_path %}doc\product-setup\manual-importation">Import Products Manually using Spreadsheets</a></li>
<li><a href="{% root_path %}doc\product-setup\manual-creation">Manually Create Products</a></li>
</ol>
<p>We are also in the process of creating some generic APIs for ecommerce providers to connect with LimeSpot platform. </p>
