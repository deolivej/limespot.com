<h2>Extended Product Attributes</h2>
<p>This section describes the fundamental high-level terms related to your LimeSpot storefront. You should assign values to the fields mentioned below before you start adding products to your online store. Product Attributes help you in organizing and managing your products better.</p>
<p>Every product has the following Product Attributes, which will be explained in this article in detail:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="#industry">Industry</a>: You should choose a suitable Industry name that provides an overview of the products you wish to sell online. You can have multiple industries associated with your LimeSpot store. </li>
<li><a href="#product-types">Product Types</a>:  A subsection of Industry that groups related products under a single identity. </li>
<li><a href="#product-variants">Product Variants</a>: Different variations of a singular product in terms of size, color or any other product parameters of your choice.</li>
<li><a href="#collections">Collections</a>: Logical clusters of different product that share some common characteristics like style, price etc. Individual products can be placed in different collections as per the business needs.</li>
</ol>
<h3><a id="industry"></a>Industry</h3>
<p>Industry provides a quick glance into the type of products you wish to sell online. LimeSpot gives you the freedom of choosing single or multiple Industries relevant to your online Store. Every industry can be associated with multiple Product Types, which can further be associated with multiple Products.</p>
<p>For more details on Product Types read further on this page.</p>
<h4>How to Create a New Industry</h4>
<ol>
<li>Select the Industries tab from the Admin Panel.</li>
<li>Click on the + button found in the top-left corner of the screen.</li>
<li>Enter the following details and click Save.</li>
<img src="{% root_path %}img/extended-attributes-1.png"></img>
</ol>
<p>The Description of Industry contains brief information about products you wish to associate with your Industry. The description field is for internal usage and its contents are never displayed to shoppers.</p>
<p>The Active checkbox is used to enable or disable a particular industry. When you disable an Industry, all its associated Product types and Porducts would become invisible to your shoppers. </p>
<h4>How to Associate Inudstries with Product Types</h4>
<ol>
<li>Select the Product Types tab from the Admin Panel</li>
<li>Select a relevant Industry from the Drop Down menu.</li>
<img src="{% root_path %}img/extended-attributes-2.png"></img>
<li>Click on + icon to create a new Product Type.</li>
<li>Fill in the required details and click Save.</li>
</ol>
<p>Suppose you want to create a Sport Goods store (similar to Nike); you could have following set of Industries and Product Types.</p>
<p>Please note that this example is for illustration purpose only. You are free to choose your own Industry/Industries and related Product Type(s). For a complete set of LimeSpot recommended Industries and Product Types click here.</p>
<p>Associating your products with the right combination of Industry & Product Type helps your customers find products and it also helps you in better product management and product placement.</p>
<h3><a id="{% root_path %}product-types"></a>Product Types</h3>
<p>Product Types can be considered as a compilation of related Products under a single identity. For example, consider Basketball as a Product Type. The associated products could be any related basket products like balls, hoops and accessories. To summarize, any basketball-related product that you wish to sell on your online shop should be associated with this Product Type.</p>
<p>You should define Product Types so as to capture different subsections of your Industry.  For example, if you are creating a store for Pet Products then some of your Product Types could be Pet Food, Pet Accessories, and Pet Medical Supplies etc. </p>
<img src="{% root_path %}img/extended-attributes-3.png"></img>
<p>The Landing page for Product Types is shown below. Note that a relevant industry can be selected from the dropdown menu. </p>
<h4>How to Create New Product Types</h4>
<ol>
<li>Select the ‘Product Types’ tab from Administration Panel</li>
<li>Choose a relevant Industry from the Drop Down menu. <i>(An empty drop down list indicates that you have not created any Industries.   You must have at least one Industry before creating Product Types.)</i> </li>
<li>Click on the + icon to create a new Product Type</li>
<li>Fill in the following details and click on Save.</li>
</ol>
<img src="{% root_path %}img/extended-attributes-4.png"></img>
<ul>
<li>Industry: Relevant Industry that is associated with the Product Type.</li>
<li><p>Parent: Parents of Product Types can be some other previously created Product Types; this feature is used when you want to create an ‘Product Type’ that acts as subset of an existing Product Type.</p>
<p>Let us revisit our previous example of Pet Food being a Product type. Suppose you want to create a new Product Type say Cat Food; then Pet Food can act as a parent of Cat Food and this means that all the products associated with Cat Food will automatically be associated with Pet Food.</p>
</li>
<li>Title: A short description for the Product Type. </li>
<li>Active checkbox: This is used to enable or disable this newly created Product Type. When you disable any Product Type then all its associated Products become invisible to your shoppers.</li>
</ul>
<h4>How to Delete a Product Type</h4>
<ol>
<li>Select the ‘Product Types’ tab from Administration Panel</li>
<li>Choose a relevant Industry from the Drop Down menu.</li>
<li>Click on the delete icon in the same row as the Product Type you want to delete.</li>
<li>Click on the OK button in the Confirmation box.</li>
</ol>
<h4>How to Associate Products with Product Types</h4>
<p>You can associate multiple products with Product Types, which can then be linked with Product Catalog so as to display all the associated products seamlessly.</p>
<ol>
<li>Select the Products tab from Administration Panel.</li>
<li>Edit an the desired product or create a new product.</li>
<li>Scroll down and look for the dropdown labeled Product Types.</li>
<li>Select an appropriate Product Type and click on Save button.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note: An empty dropdown list indicates that you currently do not have any Product Types. So create some Product Types before you can associate any products with them.</p>
<h3><a id="product-variants"></a>Product Variants</h3>
<p>If your product comes in different sizes, material or colors then instead of creating a new product for each type, you should create product variants. If there is only one version of your product you should list only a single variant under that product.</p>
<p>Before creating product variants, you should create Product Attributes. A product attribute is a field that describes the difference between Product Variants. For example, if you are selling jackets your product attributes could be ‘Size’ and ‘Color’. </p>
<p>You can have a maximum of five product attributes for your LimeSpot shop. Product attributes can be created from ‘Account’ section of Admin Panel. </p>
<img src="{% root_path %}img/extended-attributes-5.png"></img>
<h4>How to Create Product Attributes</h4>
<ol>
<li>Click on the Account section of Administrative Panel.</li>
<li>Scroll to the bottom on page and look for Product Variant Extended Attributes.</li>
<li>Fill in the required attributes.</li>
<li>Click Save button present at the Top Left corner of screen.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once you create the Product Attributes of your choice, you can find these attributes listed under the Product Variant section of Product page.</p>
<img src="{% root_path %}img/extended-attributes-6.png"></img>
<p>You can now add multiple product variants with different product attributes of your choice.  Thus in our previous example of jackets, you could have two colors available (eg, Red and Blue) in three different sizes (e.g. Small, Medium and Large).</p>
<p>Your product variants could have following combinations of Product Attributes</p>
<p>You can enter other details of product variants (Title, Barcode, Price etc.) as per your business requirements. More information on the fields that can go in a variant can be found below. </p>
<h4>How to Add Product Variants</h4>
<ol>
<li>Click on the Product section of the Administrative Panel.</li>
<li>Click on the + icon to create a new Product or click on the Edit button to add variants to an existing Product.</li>
<li>Scroll to the bottom of the page and look for a section titled Variants.</li>
<li>Click on the + icon and fill in the required details.</li>
<li>To add more variants click on the + icon again.</li>
<li>Click Save to complete the process and exit.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Product Properties</h4>
<p>Every Product Variant has nine fixed Product Properties and up to a maximum of five Product Attributes. Following is the description of nine fixed product properties.</p>
<ul>
<li>Default Variant Toggle: Sets the variant that shoppers will see by default when looking at the product.</li>
<li>Title: The title of the variant that shoppers see on your online shop.</li>
<li>Barcode: The variant&#39;s barcode, if applicable.</li>
<li>SKU: The variant&#39;s SKU number.</li>
<li>Price: The net sale price of the product variant.</li>
<li>Original Price: If the variant has been discounted, its original price.</li>
<li>Stock Override: A checkbox that permits our system to continue selling a variant irrespective of Stock Quantity. </li>
<li>Stock Quantity: It is the measure of stock available for a variant. Stock Quantity is reduced every time a product variant is sold and sale is automatically suspended if its stock quantity gets zero. Use Stock Override checkbox to disable this feature.</li>
<li>Active/Inactive Toggle: a checkbox that toggles whether or not the variant will appear for the product.</li>
</ul>
<h4>How to Delete a Product Variant</h4>
<p>You can delete a Product Variant by clicking on the Delete icon present in the same row as the product variant.</p>
<h3><a id="collections"></a>Collections</h3>
<p>A collection is a way of organizing your products by grouping them into categories. You can base these categories on similar product criteria like style, price, size etc. You are free to create your own collections and add products accordingly. For example, if you are creating an online store for Fashion clothing some of your collection names could be Spring Collection, Men’s Fashion, Summer Sale or Latest Fashion.</p>
<p>You can create as many collections as you want and associate collection with the related products. Note that a single product can be associated with one or more collections.</p>
<h4>How to Create a New Collection</h4>
<ol>
<li>Select the Collection tab from Administrative Panel.</li>
<li>Click on the + icon in the top left corner of the screen. </li>
<li>Enter data for the following fields.</li>
<img src="{% root_path %}img/extended-attributes-7.png"></img>
<li>Click the Save button in the Top Left corner of the screen</li>
</ol>
<p>Below is a description of the different fields that go in a Collection:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Parent: Existing Collections can be marked as parents of other collections; this feature is used when you want to create a collection that acts as a subset of any previously created collection. Let us relate this feature with our example of a Fashion Clothing store. Suppose you have a collection named Summer Special; and you create a new collection named ‘Super Sale’ that contains all items currently on sale. Thus if you want put a sale on all products of Summer Special, you can simply mark the collection ‘Super Sale’ as a parent of collection named ‘Summer Special’.<p>
<p>This means that all products under the collection Summer Special are automatically added to the collection Super Sale.</p></li>
<li>Title: A short description of the collection.</li>
<li>Active: This checkbox is used to make collections visible or invisible on your store. </li>
<li>Products: All of your previously created products are listed under the Products section. You can add products to the collections by activating the checkbox present adjacent to the Products. There is no limit on the number of products that can be added to a single collection.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can Edit, Copy or Delete any collection from the landing page of the Collection section. </p>
<img src="{% root_path %}img/extended-attributes-8.png"></img>
<p>You can insert your collections directly in a ‘Product Catalog’ to display all associated products automatically. For instructions click here.</p>
