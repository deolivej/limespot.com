<h2>HTML Objects</h2>
<p>You can use Custom Contents to create HTML Tags enclosing files of various formats such as multimedia (audio/video), Text, Flash, iFrames, etc. Custom Contents can be added to your online shops to enable several types of HTML supported functionalities.</p>
<p>Some of the top uses of Custom Contents are:</p>
<ul>
<li>To show rich graphics files.</li>
<li>To display videos.</li>
<li>Create forms for user input.</li>
<li>To implement JavaScript.</li>
<li>Creative Animations and Visual Effects.</li>
</ul>
<p>Custom Contents can be accessed from the Admin Panel. The landing page for Custom Contents looks like this: </p>
<img src="{{ root_path }}/img/custom-contents-1.png"></img>
<p>From the Landing Page of Custom Contents you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create new Custom Contents</li>
<li>Copy existing Custom Contents</li>
<li>Edit Custom Contents</li>
<li>Delete Custom Contents</li>
<li>View Custom Content as seen by your customers during Runtime</li>
</ul>
<h3>How to Create Custom Contents</h3>
<ol>
<li>Select the Custom Contents tab in the Admin Panel.</li>
<li>Click on the + icon from top left corner of page. You will see the following screen:</li>
<img src="{{ root_path }}/img/custom-contents-2.png"></img>
<li>Enter the Title for Custom Content you are creating.</li>
<li>Choose an image file that you want to display on your online storefront.</li>
<li>Enter the description for internal reference. You customers never see the contents of Description field. </li>
<li>Enter the HTML code that gets executed when users click on image.</li>
<li>Toggle the Active checkbox on or off, depending on if you want the Custom Content to be visible to your shoppers.</li>
<li>Choose appropriate Targeting Rules.*</li>
<li>Click on the Save button to complete the process. </li>
</ol>
<p>* Our system provides a pre-generated list of Targeting Rules that cover most widely used conditions. However, you are free to create your own Targeting Rules from the Admin Panel.</p>
<p>Our engine treats Custom Contents just as regular products, and thus you can add targeting rules to them. See Add Targeting Rules for more information.</p>
<p>For example, by adding an appropriate Targeting Rule to Custom Contents, you can show two different marketing videos to men and women. A Targeting Rule would be created to identify the userâ€™s gender and our engine will display the related video accordingly. </p>
<p>You can add as many Custom Contents as you want on a single page of your LimeSpot powered shop. You can click here to learn the steps of Adding Custom Contents to Product Catalogs.</p>
