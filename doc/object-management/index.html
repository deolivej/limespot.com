<h2>What Are Objects?</h2>
<p>Objects are the basic building blocks of your LimeSpot powered online storefront. Some of the examples can be Products, Images, URLs, and Video links. Objects can also be identified as individual entities that are created and targeted (see <a href="{% root_path %}/doc/targeting-products/">Targeting Rules</a>) to showcase user-specific contents.</p>
<p>For instances, if you are creating a store for Sporting Goods then your objects can be related products like Tennis Racquets, Shoes, Jerseys, or display images, marketing videos, banners etc. To summarize, any element that is visible on you online Shop is a type of Object.  </p>
<p>Different types of objects and their efficacy is described below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Custom Contents: They are used to create custom design elements for your online shop. You can embed rich media content using HTML tags that support audio, video, flash and several other types of file formats. Refer to <a href="{% root_path %}/doc/object-management/html-objects/">Custom Contents</a> for details.</li>
<li>External Contents: You can use External Contents to create hyperlinks to external web addresses present outside the scope of your LimeSpot shop. Hyperlinks assist in redirecting customer traffic to other websites, Social media channels or any other URLs of your choice.  Refer to <a href="{% root_path %}/doc/object-management/external-objects/">External Contents</a> for details.</li>
<li>Products: They are individual items that you wish to sell at your LimeSpot powered online store. Products are often physical goods, but can also be digital downloads (eBooks, software etc.) or services. Please refer to <a href="{% root_path %}/doc/object-management/products/">Products</a> for details.</li>
</ol>
<p>Objects are associated with Targeting Rules to generate personalized and customized product catalogs for each of your shoppers.</p>
<p>For example, you can add a Targeting rule that determines shopperâ€™s gender to display different product options, graphics or external links for male and female lines of customers.</p>
<p>Objects sharing similar properties can be added into Collections. You are free to create collections of you choice and group multiple objects into one collection. The advantage of creating Collections is that you can add a collection directly to Product Catalogs to display all related Objects</p>
