<h2>Store Setup</h2>
<p>Congratulations on signing up for LimeSpot! You are on your way to creating a social, personalized experience for your customers.</p>
<p>Some of the next steps you should take in setting up your LimeSpot store include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="{% root_path %}doc/store-setup/payment-setup">Setting up a Payment Gateway</a> for your store</li>
<li><a href="{% root_path %}doc/store-setup/google-analytics">Setting up Google Analytics</a> for your store so you can get detailed analysis on your store&#39;s performance</li>
</ul>
<p>Once these are complete, we suggest <a href="{% root_path %}doc/product-setup">setting up your store&#39;s products</a>. Don&#39;t worry: this is very easy to do, and if you already have an online store with a major e-commerce provider it&#39;s automatic!</p>
