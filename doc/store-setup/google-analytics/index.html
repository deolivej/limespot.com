<h2>Google Analytics</h2>
<p>Google Analytics is a free service from Google that captures detailed data about a webpage&#39;s traffic and sale activity. It can be used to track your website&#39;s visitors from a variety of referral sources, including search engines, social networks, direct visits, or other websites.  Your site&#39;s sales performance, transactions, revenue, and many other commerce metrics can be measured through its e-commerce features.</p>
