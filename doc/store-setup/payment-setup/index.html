<h2>Using Payment Gateways</h2>
<p>If you already have an e-commerce store LimeSpot can bring you enhanced personalization and customization while retaining your store's core  infrastructure. As a result you can continue using your current payment gateways and processes. When a shopper purchases a product on a LimeSpot powered shop our system redirects user to your existing payment page which is automatically populated with required product details and payment amount. This makes the shopping experience easy and secure. </p>
<p>For small and medium businesses without any ecommerce presence, a fully functional LimeSpot store can be created in just a couple of hours. You can manually add products or use spreadsheets to upload multiple products. Currently, we accept PayPal as a preferred payment gateway partner for processing financial transactions. You should have a valid merchant account with PayPal and associate it with your LimeSpot powered online storefront. To set up a PayPal merchant account click <a href="https://www.paypal.com/ca/webapps/mpp/merchant#sticky-nav">here</a>.</p>
<p>After creating a PayPal account, you should link it with your LimeSpot shop. You can click on Payment Gateways link from the Admin Panel or click <a href="https://app.limespot.com/admin/paymentGateways/">here</a> to connect your LimeSpot account with PayPal. </p>
