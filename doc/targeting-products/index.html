<h2>Targeting Rules Overview & Features</h2>
<p>Social Networks collect huge amount of user-data. For instance, Facebook has profile information related to age, gender, location, and interests for more than 1 billion active users. Using LimeSpot, companies can use this profile information to target products so as to match the tastes and preferences of their individual shoppers. Product targeting on LimeSpot can be done in two ways from the Admin Panel: </p>
<ol>
<li>Setting up specific Targeting Rules from Store Settings.</li>
<li>Using the Targeting tool present under Products and Contents.</li>
</ol>
<p>Targeting products help you create personalised stores, wherein products are visible only to the customers who are most likely to be interested in buying them. Targeting Rules are sets of logic statements that search a customer&#39;s social network profile to see if the Rule&#39;s criterion is met or not. For example, a simple Targeting Rule could check if the shopper is female and under the age of twenty-five. Targeting Rules can be set on following criterion:</p>
<p>1.	Person is within a certain age range.</p>
<p>2.	Person is of certain gender.</p>
<p>3.	Person is in a certain relationship.</p>
<p>4.	Person&#39;s location.</p>
<p>5.	Person&#39;s hometown.</p>
<p>6.	Person&#39;s interests are relevant to a specific keyword.</p>
<p>7.	Person&#39;s interests include a specific category.</p>
<p>You can also target products for a specific set of keywords. Our engine checks these keywords against the social profiles of your customers to prioritize products that match the interests of your customers. Keyword targeting can be done from Products page or by using the Targeting Tool.</p>
<p>Targeting Rules can be attached to products or other objects (see <a href="{% root_path %}doc/object-management/">Object Creation & Management</a>) such as images, videos etc. to determine their relevance to specific sections of customers. For instance, an image or a product with an attached targeting rule that checks if a shopper is female would only show up in a LimeSpot-powered store to female shoppers. </p>
<p>For information on how targeting rules are applied to individual objects, see <a href="{% root_path %}doc/object-management/prioritize-filter">Prioritizing & Filtering Objects</a>.</p>
<p>A single targeting rule can be applied to a range of products. In previous example, if you create a store with designer clothing apparel, then a targeting rule that checks for male customers should be attached to all your male centric products and vice versa. Please note that a single product can be linked with up to 64 targeting rules or keywords.</p>
<p>When you create targeting rules, your goal should be to create a unique and distinct rule for each type of customer you want to target. For example, if your target customers include married men who like golf, or teenage girls who like popular music, or even single adult women who like opera but not television, you should create a distinct targeting rule for each of those types of people.</p>
<p>As such, a good starting point before creating targeting rules in the LimeSpot Database would be to go through your product catalog and write down the qualities or attributes of each type of customer you want to target.</p>
<p>Below is a screenshot of the landing page for Targeting Rules. You can see different types of attributes that can be identified and used to target products to different customer segments.</p>
