<h2>Improving Rules</h2>
<p>There are a few critical design principles that should be kept in mind while creating targeting rules, and several processes that should be implemented to improve them on an ongoing basis.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Use association while trying to pin down a shopper&#39;s interests.</p>
<p>The interests of a person can be identified by examining the pages they like, but keep in mind that they would realistically like pages associated with a trend as opposed to a page for the trend itself. For example, someone who likes British culture would probably not like a page titled "British culture". However, this person would like or have otherwise interacted with specific people, places, and things that are associated with British culture; for instance, they might like pages about London, The Beatles, Winston Churchill, Doctor Who, etc.</p>

<li>
<p>Ensure that criteria are exhaustive and specific.</p>
<p>When identifying if a shopper is interested in something don&#39;t just list a few keywords to check for. People may have interacted with a variety of pages to do with that interest, so try to be exhaustive in the criteria and keywords you use. For example, if you are trying to identify whether or not someone likes a famous actor you should find all the movies and television shows they have appeared in. Subsequently you should use that information to create detailed, specific criteria to look for.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Associate products with more than one customer demographic.</p>
<p>If applicable, you should give products targeting rules such that they show up to more than one target market. While targeting products towards their top target market is key, secondary and tertiary target markets are also important.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Break complicated targeting rules into smaller sets of generic rules.</p>
<p>Two important features of the LimeSpot platform are that individual targeting rules can be applied to a range of products; and individual products can have multiple targeting rules. As a result, sometimes it’s more effective to break a complicated targeting rule into various simpler targeting rules that can be reused in different scenarios. For example a targeting rule for a Female New Yorker who likes Katy Perry can be broken down into three different rules: Females, residents of New York, and Katy Perry fans.</p>
