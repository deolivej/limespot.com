        <h4>What does LimeSpot do?</h4>
        <p>LimeSpot is a B2B e-commerce service that generates social, branded catalogs which are personalized for individual shoppers. Using the profile information already shared on social networks a LimeSpot-powered store will tailor its appearance and content to the person viewing it. The shopper will immediately see the products they are most likely to be interested in: those designed for their gender, age, likes and location.</p>

        <h4>What makes LimeSpot different from other e-commerce platforms?</h4>
        <p>There are three major qualities that make LimeSpot unique in the world of e-commerce. First, it creates a new, branded sales channel because LimeSpot-powered stores can be put on social networks in addition to conventional websites. Second, it increases sales efficiencies. Shoppers going to LimeSpot-powered stores will automatically and immediately see the products they are most likely to purchase, which helps ensure sales are made before they leave the store. Third, the consumer experience is improved in several ways. In addition to seeing their favourite products instantly, shoppers are provided with many social media features and the knowledge that their profile information remains private and secure when they use a LimeSpot-powered store.</p>
        <p>Other ways in which LimeSpot is different from other e-commerce platforms include its affordability to companies of all sizes and its realtime synchronization with a business' existing e-commerce database.</p>

        <h4>How are products matched to the traits and preferences of different customers?</h4>
        <p>The merchant of a given store can create targeting rules for individual products that are similar to "tags". For instance, they could tag a shirt with "female", "ages 17-25", and "likes horses" to have that shirt matched to customers who identify with those qualities.</p>

        <h4>What profile information can LimeSpot use to sort a firm's catalog?</h4> 
        <p>Generally, the sort of information a user would share with their friends on a given social network. On Facebook, for example, LimeSpot can process age, gender, location, hometown, current location, relationship status, keywords in liked pages, and the categories of liked pages in addition to a shopper's purchase history with a given business. A firm can use any combination of this data to match products to shoppers, but does not have to use all of it.</p>

        <h4>What if customers want to purchase a gift for someone else? Won't the catalog be tuned to their preferences exclusively?</h4>
        <p>If a customer wants to purchase a gift for someone else they can use LimeSpot's gift feature. They simply need to choose  someone to whom they are connected on the social network they are using (eg, from their friends list on Facebook) and the LimeSpot-powered store will adjust its content to the selected friend's profile information. The viewer will then see the products their friend would most likely to be interested in.</p>

        <h4>What does the name LimeSpot mean?</h4>
        <p>It is a wordplay on 'limelight' and 'spotlight'.</p>

        <h4>Can LimeSpot be used on social networks other than Facebook?</h4>
        <p>Yes. LimeSpot will be integrated with a variety of social networks. At the moment, we are integrated with Facebook and LinkedIn.</p>

        <h4>How can LimeSpot help my business?</h4>
        <p>LimeSpot gives you a new, branded sales channel on social networks, increases your sales efficiencies by matching shoppers to the products they are most likely to purchase, and improves your customers' e-commerce experience with social media features. Indirectly, LimeSpot allows your customers to spread authentic experiences with your products on social networks and prompts you to learn more about who your products are designed for as you decide how to target them.</p>

        <h4>How will having a LimeSpot-powered store attract new customers?</h4>
        <p>Social media allows for the rapid spread of information. If a customer buys a product from your bricks-and-mortar store they might tell a few friends about their purchase, but no more. When a customer buys a product from your LimeSpot-powered catalog, they have the option to "share" the story with all their social connections simultaneously. Information about your products and business also spreads on social networks when a customer reviews a product or discusses it with their friends.</p>

        <h4>LimeSpot is a new technology and my customers may not be aware of it. How can I drive traffic to my LimeSpot-powered store?</h4>
        <p>Regular traffic on your social network page will lead to traffic on your LimeSpot store, so a successful social media strategy will help a lot. In particular, you should place links to your LimeSpot store in some of your social network posts. For example, if you put a picture of a product on Facebook you could also note that it's available for purchase right on your Facebook page.</p>
        <p>Additionally, we suggest you announce your new store in the places your customers already look, such as your main website and any newsletters or brochures you send out.</p>
        <p>If you want to be a first mover in LimeSpot technology, you could offer a small material incentive for people to use your LimeSpot-powered store. A 10% discount on a single purchase, for example, would almost certainly motivate your customers to do something as simple as authorizing LimeSpot to show them a personalized catalog.</p> 

        <h4>How does LimeSpot get permission from customers to process their profile information in order to create personalized catalogs?</h4>
        <p>The first time a customer visits a LimeSpot-powered store they will be prompted to authorize LimeSpot for access to their social network profile information.</p> 

        <h4>How do I pay for a license?</h4>
        <p>Once you choose a plan you will be billed directly by LimeSpot.</p>

        <h4>When do I get billed?</h4>
        <p>At the end of each month.</p>

        <h4>How will our firm's regular website be affected by LimeSpot?</h4>
        <p>You can integrate LimeSpot into your traditional website if you want to, or keep it just the way it is. If LimeSpot is integrated with your website, customers will be prompted to log in with a social network account upon arriving on your site to enjoy a personalized shopping experience.</p>

        <h4>Will our company's LimeSpot-powered store look different to an individual each time they look at it?</h4>
        <p>Yes, a customer will see a slightly different selection of products each time. If your company wants it to, LimeSpot can track which products an individual customer has seen and clicked on previously, then ensure they do not appear as frequently. Other products that closely match the customer's traits and preferences will show up instead. In addition, the products a customer sees will change as they update their social network profile. If their tastes in art change, for example, the content of the LimeSpot-powered store will be altered to reflect that.</p>

        <h4>How is the appearance of our LimeSpot-powered store configured?</h4> 
        <p>You can fully customize the appearance and content of your catalog through an intuitive, user-friendly UI.</p>

        <h4>How will our company's product catalog be integrated with our LimeSpot-powered store?</h4>
        <p>A variety of techniques exist for doing this, such as using xml or api files, connecting to your company's server, or connecting to your company's existing third-party e-commerce provider (such as Shopify). Your LimeSpot catalog and all transactions that occur there will be fully integrated with your other e-commerce processes, so that you don't have to manage multiple databases.</p>

        <h4>How can our transactions server be integrated with our LimeSpot-powered store?</h4>
        <p>Transactions on a LimeSpot-powered store can be directly connected to your website's existing e-commerce transactions server, or to your company's Shopify account.</p>

        <h4>Is LimeSpot responsible for managing customer data such as billing information and purchase history, or is the merchant?</h4>
        <p>The merchant is responsible for managing customer data.</p>

        <h4>Will LimeSpot work on mobile phones?</h4>
        <p>Yes, we are in the process of creating a mobile application.</p>

      <div class="tab-pane" id="shoppers">
        <h4>Will I get spammed by companies if I use a LimeSpot-powered store?</h4>
        <p>No. The user decides which merchants they wish to interact with, and their personal information remains entirely private. It is impossible for a business to use information from LimeSpot to send someone spam.</p>

        <h4>Do I get charged to use a LimeSpot powered site?</h4>
        <p>There is no charge to the shopper. You only pay for the products that you buy.</p>

        <h4>Why would I authorize LimeSpot to access my profile information?</h4>
        <p>In order to enjoy a personalized and social shopping experience with the brands you trust. When you use a LimeSpot-powered store you'll automatically see products matched to your profile information, so you don't have to dig through items that aren't suitable for your gender, age, or interests. You can also share products directly with your friends' social network pages, make lists to organize or compare items, and review or discuss products.</p>

        <h4>How does LimeSpot manage my profile information? Are there privacy concerns?</h4>
        <p>LimeSpot only uses your profile information real time when you visit a LimeSpot-powered store. Nobody sees your information, and it isn't shared with anyone. We designed our system to provide consumers with the knowledge that their information is private and secure when using a LimeSpot-powered store.</p>

        <h4>Can I use a LimeSpot-powered store to buy a gift for a friend?</h4>
        <p>If you want to purchase a gift for someone you can use LimeSpot's gift feature. You simply need to select someone to whom you are connected on a social network and the LimeSpot-powered store will adjust its content to the selected friend's profile information. You will then see the products your friend would most likely to be interested in.</p>

        <h4>How do I get to a personalized LimeSpot-powered store?</h4>
        <p>Most of our clients will have access via their website and/or Facebook Page. Look for the distinct icon offering you 'personalized shopping' or entrance to their 'Facebook Shop'. Alternatively, you can go to our website to find a list of our clients and direct links to their stores.</p>

        <h4>Do I need to install anything on my computer to use a LimeSpot-powered store?</h4>
        <p>No.</p>

        <h4>The products I saw on a LimeSpot-powered store seemed to match my interests very well. How is that possible?</h4>
        <p>The LimeSpot engine looks at your profile information to determine which products someone with your gender, age, interests, etc. would likely be interested in. Products that match you as an individual are then found from a business' product database.</p>

        <h4>The products I saw on a LimeSpot-powered store did not match me very well. Why is that?</h4>
        <p>This could be because the business responsible for the store hasn't targeted its products well or your profile information is not up to date. If the products you see are totally wrong for you (eg, clothes for the incorrect gender) please contact us or the business whose page you visited.</p>

        <h4>I authorized LimeSpot to access my profile information, but now I've decided I don't want to use it. How can I do this?</h4>
        <p>By removing the LimeSpot app from your social network account.</p>

        <h4>When I use a LimeSpot-powered store, do I purchase from LimeSpot or the merchant managing the specific shop I'm using?</h4>

        <p>Please contact the merchant. If the merchant can’t solve your problem they will get in touch with LimeSpot.</p>

        <h4>Why are the shipping and handling charges different on various LimeSpot-powered stores?</h4>
        <p>Because these charges are determined by individual merchants, not LimeSpot.</p>
